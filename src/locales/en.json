    "q3": "What is osteopathy, and how is it different from physiotherapy?",

Physiotherapy is more exercise- and rehabilitation-based. Both work well together, and your therapist may combine techniques for the best results.",

    "a4": "Manual therapy techniques are usually gentle and should not cause significant pain. You may feel mild pressure or stretching, but it should always feel comfortable. If anything feels too intense, your therapist will adjust the technique immediately."
